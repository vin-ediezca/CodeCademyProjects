### SCOPE ###

* **Scope** is the idea in programming that some variables are accessible/inaccessible from other parts of the program.
* **Blocks** are statements that exist within curly braces `{}`.
* **Global scope** refers to the context within which variables are accessible to every part of the program.
* **Global variables** are variables that exist within global scope.
* **Block scope** refers to the context within which variables that are accessible only within the block they are defined.
* **Local variables** are variables that exist within block scope.
* **Global namespace** is the space in our code that contains globally scoped information.
* **Scope pollution** is when too many variables exist in a namespace or variable names are reused.
