### Request 2 ###

1. GET and POST requests can be created a variety of ways.

2. Use AJAX to asynchronously request data from APIs. `fetch()` and `async`/`await` are new functionalities developed in ES6 (promises) and ES8 respectively.

3. Promises are a new type of JavaScript object that represent data that will eventually be returned from a request.

4. `fetch()` is a web API that can be used to create requests. `fetch()` will return promises.

5. We can chain `.then()` methods to handle promises returned by `fetch()`.

6. The `.json()` method converts a returned promise to a JSON object.

7. `async` is a keyword that is used to create functions that will return promises.

8. `await` is a keyword that is used to tell a program to continue moving through the message queue while a promise resolves.

9. `await` can only be used within functions declared with `async`.
